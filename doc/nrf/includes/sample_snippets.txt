The sample supports :ref:`zephyr:snippets` for typical use cases, and to activate sample extensions.
You can find the OpenThread-related snippets in the :file:`snippets` directory of the |NCS| main directory.
All snippets with the ``ot`` prefix are suitable for this sample.

Specify the corresponding snippet names in the |SNIPPET| CMake option.
For more information about using snippets, see :ref:`zephyr:using-snippets` in the Zephyr documentation.

To use the snippets, you need to add the sample name as a prefix before the ``SNIPPET`` CMake argument.

For example:

.. parsed-literal::
   :class: highlight

   west build -b *board_target* -p -- -D|snippet|="ot-logging;ot-usb"

The following snippets are available:

* ``ot-ci`` - Disables boot banner and and shel prompt.
* ``ot-debug`` - Enables logging using RTT and debugging the Thread sample by enabling :c:func:`__ASSERT()` statements globally.
  For additional options, refer to :ref:`RTT logging <ug_logging_backends_rtt>`.
* ``ot-diag_gpio`` - Configures DK's Buttons and LEDs for diagnostic GPIO commands.
  For more information, see `OpenThread Factory Diagnostics Module Reference`_.
* ``ot-zephyr-l2`` - Enables the Zephyr networking layer.
* ``ot-usb`` - Enables USB transport support.

  .. note::
     The ``ot-usb`` snippet does not support the ``nrf54l15dk/nrf54l15/cpuapp`` and ``nrf54l15dk/nrf54l10/cpuapp`` board targets because these platform does not have USB peripheral.
